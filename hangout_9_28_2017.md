# Hangout 9/28/2017


## Update from Dominic

- Started work on a
  [paper on in-plane modes and finite temperature modeling of drumhead modes](./cooling/cooling.tex).
  This may be worth looking at because it hase some background on
  the physics, computational algorithms, etc. But currently still
  in pretty rough shape.
- Single-plane to multi-plane instability.
- Spectra of drumhead modes.


## Bjorn status

- Create initial conditions
- Ground state from uE
- Add sin(kx) to z component
- Verify that initial state looks reasonable
- Let simulations run
- Record ion positions
- PSD
- Compare with axial spectra from `mode_analysis.py`
