# Hangout 9/12/2017

## Some questions

- How are we going to collaborate?
  One option is to use the ion-trapping-notes repo.
  Another option is to start a new repo.
  
- Have you been able to check out one of the examples? Have you run into any
  issues thus far?
  . With the code or examples.
  . With git or other tools.
  
- Update from me:
  . Preliminary confirmation of one-to-two-plane transition.
    * The transition frequency is in the right ball park.
    * But need better data. Simulations were somewhat over damped so transition
    is a bit washed out.


## Modeling of Kerr effect in ultra-cold ion crystals

- First we need to establish the unperturbed mode frequency (because we're
  interested in a level shift).
- Create initial conditions:
  . Ground state
  . Excite one of the drum head modes (not the center of mass mode)
  . Let the simulation run and record the ion trajectories
  . After some time compute the spectrum of the axial ion motion (PSD, we have
    example code snippets for how to do that)
- Then do the same thing but in addition to exciting the mode from above also
  excite one other mode. This should give the Kerr shifted frequency. Compare
  that frequency with the unperturbed frequency.

Some comments:
- We should aim to use low k modes (high frequency) because they are more
  distinct and well separated from one another.
- We should choose the Penning trap rotation frequency such that the spectrum is
  maximally spread out to make the individual resonances well resolved.
- Initially we should use a reduced number of ions (perhaps 19) because for
  smaller ion numbers the resonances are more resolved from one another. This
  way we can use larger mode excitations to exaggerate the frequency shifts.
- The center of mass mode is special if all ions are of the same species. The
  cold-atoms algorithms are general enough to deal with ensembles with multiple
  species (different isotopes or ions and molecules) but I think at least
  initially it will be easier to just look at non-center-of-mass modes.
- Where are we going to get analytical results from? For verification.
